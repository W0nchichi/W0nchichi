## Welcome to my Repo

I am Luca Rovera - a university student at the University of Queensland currently studying a Bachelor of Computer Science / Master of Cyber Security Dual Degree.
- 🔮 As of now, I'm working on a DBMS (Database Management System) programmed in Rust 
- 🧙‍♂️ I have a (very) high interest in game modding in titles such as rain world, although I haven't uploaded the repositories as of yet! 
- 🪄 Since 2020, I have participated in 5 game jams, and have come second place once!
- ♠️ Most of my work is held by another user, @AskiiDev due to the high amount of collaboration!
